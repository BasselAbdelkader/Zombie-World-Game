RangedWeapon is a new abstract class that extends WeaponItem, contains implementation for methods common to both Shotgun and SniperRifle.

Ammo system implemented in tick(Location, Actor) and tick(Location) methods in both Shotgun and SniperRifle. When the weapon is in Player's inventory, allow firing if the weapon has ammo. When the weapon is on the Ground, disallow firing but keep ammo. Could not be implemented in RangedWeapon abstract class as SniperRifle has additional logic in tick(Location, Actor) for concentration implementation.

To fire the SniperRifle, the Player chooses to Setup the sniper rifle. Then, the following occurs on the same turn as Setup, choose a Zombie on the current map as target, choose to fire immediately or aim on the current turn. If the Player chose to aim, the option to aim or fire will be presented again on the next turn, along with movement or other actions as usual. The option to aim can only be used twice. If the Player chooses any action other than aim or fire after setting up the sniper rifle OR the Player takes damage from any source, concentration is lost and the Player must start over from Setup.
When the Player chooses to fire, the Player's active weapon is set as the Sniper Rifle currently being used(when getWeapon() is called by AttackAction, the active weapon is returned if set), AttackAction is instantiated and executed to attack the target. The Player's active weapon is unset. Ammo is decreased and the damage log returned from AttackAction is returned.

Firing the Shotgun on the other hand is a single-turn process that cannot be interrupted. After choosing to Setup the Shotgun, the Player is asked which direction to fire in, the Player's active weapon is set, an AttackAction is instantiated and executed for every actor in range of the Shotgun blast and active weapon is unset. Ammo is decremented. The damage log from each AttackAction.execute() is combined and returned.

This implementation tries to extend and reuse existing system functions as much as possible, namely Menu to get Player input and AttackAction for damaging target(s). Slight changes were needed in AttackAction to accommadate varying hit chance for Sniper Rifle, but this change is reusable for future implementations of ranged weapons.
