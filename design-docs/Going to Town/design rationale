New classes: Garage, Vehicle

Garage is a new subclass of Ground, it is impassable to actors other than the Player so it cannot be blocked.
Vehicle is a new subclass of Item, it cannot be picked up and is added to the location of Garage, with an allowable action TravelAction.

Thus when the Player enters the Garage location, they are given the option to use execute the TravelAction which moves them to another map - Town map.

I think this implementation is simple to understand and extensible to include more features such as fuel or other conditional travel functions.
